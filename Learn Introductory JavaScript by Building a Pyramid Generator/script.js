/*
Step 1: 
JavaScript is the programming language that powers the web. Unlike the HTML and CSS you have learned previously, JavaScript is most commonly used to write logic instead of markup.
One of the most important concepts in programming is variables. A variable points to a specific memory address that stores a value. 
Variables are given a name which can be used throughout your code to access that value.
Declaring a variable means giving it a name. In JavaScript, this is often done with the let keyword. For example, here is how you would declare a hello variable:
                let hello;
Variable naming follows specific rules: names can include letters, numbers, dollar signs, and underscores, but cannot contain spaces and must not begin with a number.
Declare a character variable in your code.
Note: It is common practice to end statements in JavaScript with a semicolon. ; 
*/

//let character;

/*
Step 2:
Your character variable currently does not have a value. You can assign a value using the assignment operator =. For example:
                let hello = "Hello";
Assigning a value to a variable at the moment of its declaration is known as initialization.
Initialize your character variable by assigning it the value "Hello" during its declaration.
*/

// let character = "Hello";

/*
Step 3:
JavaScript has seven primitive data types, with String being one of them. In JavaScript, a string represents 
a sequence of characters and can be enclosed in either single (') or double (") quotes.
Note that strings are immutable, which means once they are created, they cannot be changed.
Change your "Hello" string to use single quotes.
*/

// let character = 'Hello';

/*
Step 4:
The console allows you to print and view JavaScript output. 
You can send information to the console using console.log(). For example, this code will print "Naomi" to the console:
                let developer = "Naomi";
                console.log(developer);
The code above accesses the developer variable with its name in the console.log(). 
Note that the value between the parentheses is the value that will be printed.
Print the value of the character variable to the console. Then, click the "Console" button to view the JavaScript console.
*/

// let character = 'Hello';
// console.log(character);

/*
Step 5:
When a variable is declared with the let keyword, you can reassign (or change the value of) that variable later on. 
In this example, the value of programmer is changed from "Naomi" to "CamperChan".
                let programmer = "Naomi";
                programmer = "CamperChan";
Note that when reassigning a variable that has already been declared, you do not use the let keyword.
After your console.log, assign the value "World" to your character variable.
*/

// let character = 'Hello';
// console.log(character);
// character = "World";

/*
Step 6:
Now log your character variable to the console again. You should see the string "Hello", then the string "World", in the console.
*/

// let character = 'Hello';
// console.log(character);
// character = "World";
// console.log(character);

/*
Step 7:
When variable names are more than one word, there are specific naming conventions for how you capitalize the words. In JavaScript, the convention to use is camel case.
Camel case means that the first word in the name is entirely lowercase, but the following words are all title-cased. Here are some examples of camel case:
                let variableOne;
                let secondVariable;
                let yetAnotherVariable;
                let thisIsAnAbsurdlyLongName;
Use camel case to declare a new secondCharacter variable.
*/

// let character = 'Hello';
// console.log(character);
// character = "World";
// console.log(character);
// let secondCharacter;

/*
Step 8:
When you declare a variable without initializing it, it is considered uninitialized. Currently, your secondCharacter variable is uninitialized.
Add a console.log() to see what the value of your secondCharacter variable is.
*/

// let character = 'Hello';
// console.log(character);
// character = "World";
// let secondCharacter;
// console.log(secondCharacter);

/*
Step 9:
The default value of an uninitialized variable is undefined. This is a special data type that represents a value that does not have a definition yet.
You can still assign a value to an uninitialized variable. Here is an example:
                let uninitialized;
                uninitialized = "assigned";
Assign the string "Test" to your secondCharacter variable below your declaration. Open the console to see how your log has changed.
*/

// let character = 'Hello';
// console.log(character);
// character = "World";
// let secondCharacter;
// secondCharacter = "Test";
// console.log(secondCharacter);

/*
Step 10:
You can also assign the value of a variable to another variable. For example:
                let first = "One";
                let second = "Two";
                second = first;
The second variable would now have the value "One".
To see this in action, change your secondCharacter assignment from "Test" to your character variable.
Then open the console to see what gets logged.
*/

// let character = 'Hello';
// console.log(character);
// character = "World";
// let secondCharacter;
// secondCharacter = character;
// console.log(secondCharacter);

/*
Step 11:
You are now ready to declare your next variable. Remove both console.log statements, and the character reassignment.
Also remove your secondCharacter variable, but leave the character initialization unchanged.
*/

// let character = 'Hello';

/*
Step 12:
Use let to declare a count variable. Assign it the number 8. When using a number value, you do not use quotes. For example:
        let money = 100;
*/

// let character = 'Hello';
// let count = 8;

/*
Step 13:
With the number data type, you can perform mathematical operations, like addition. Try printing count + 1 to the console.
*/

// let character = 'Hello';
// let count = 8;
// console.log(count + 1);

/*
Step 14:
You can also perform subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). 
Feel free to experiment with the operators and numbers in your console.log. When you are ready to move on, remove the console.log.
*/

// let character = 'Hello';
// let count = 8;

/*
Step 15:
In programming, you will often need to work with lots of data. There are many data structures that can help you organize and manage your data. 
One of the most basic data structures is an array.
An array is a non-primitive data type that can hold a series of values. Non-primitive data types differ from primitive data types in that they can hold more complex data. 
Primitive data types like strings and numbers can only hold one value at a time.
Arrays are denoted using square brackets ([]). Here is an example of a variable with the value of an empty array:
        let array = [];
Declare a rows variable and assign it an empty array.
*/

// let character = 'Hello';
// let count = 8;
// let rows = [];

/*
Step 16:
When an array holds values, or elements, those values are separated by commas. Here is an array that holds two strings:
        let array = ["first", "second"];
Change your rows declaration to be an array with the strings "Naomi", "Quincy", and "CamperChan". 
The order of values in an array is important, so follow that order. Remember that strings are case-sensitive.
*/

// let character = 'Hello';
// let count = 8;
// let rows = ["Naomi", "Quincy", "CamperChan"];

/*
Step 17:
You can access the values inside an array using the index of the value. An index is a number representing the position of the value in the array, starting from 0 for the first value.
You can access the value using bracket notation, such as array[0].
Use console.log and bracket notation to print the first value in your rows array.
*/

// let character = 'Hello';
// let count = 8;
// let rows = ["Naomi", "Quincy", "CamperChan"];
// console.log(rows[0]);

/*
Step 18:
Arrays are special in that they are considered mutable. This means you can change the value at an index directly.
For example, this code would assign the number 25 to the second element in the array:
                let array = [1, 2, 3];
                array[1] = 25;
Update the third element of your rows array to be the number 10. Then print the rows array to your console.
*/

// let character = 'Hello';
// let count = 8;
// let rows = ["Naomi", "Quincy", "CamperChan"];
// console.log(rows[0]);
// rows[2] = 10;
// console.log(rows);

/*
Step 19:
Notice how the value inside your rows array has been changed directly? This is called mutation. 
As you learn more about arrays, you will learn when to mutate an array, and when you should not.
Before moving on, this is a great opportunity to learn a common array use. 
Currently, your code accesses the last element in the array with rows[2]. 
But you may not know how many elements are in an array when you want the last one.
You can make use of the .length property of an array - this returns the number of elements in the array. 
To get the last element of any array, you can use the following syntax:
                array[array.length - 1]
array.length returns the number of elements in the array. By subtracting 1, you get the index of the last element in the array. 
You can apply this same concept to your rows array.
Update your rows[2] to dynamically access the last element in the rows array. Refer to the example above to help you.
You should not see anything change in your console.
*/

// let character = 'Hello';
// let count = 8;
// let rows = ["Naomi", "Quincy", "CamperChan"];
// console.log(rows[0]);
// rows[rows.length - 1] = 10;
// console.log(rows);

/*
Step 20:
For now, remove your first console log and your rows[2] assignment. Leave the second rows log statement for later.
*/

// let character = 'Hello';
// let count = 8;
// let rows = ["Naomi", "Quincy", "CamperChan"];
// console.log(rows);

/*
Step 21:
A method in JavaScript is a function that's associated with certain values or objects. An example you've already encountered is the .log() method, which is part of the console object.
Arrays have their own methods, and the first you will explore is the .push() method. This allows you to "push" a value to the end of an array. Here is an example to add the number 12 to the end of an array:
                array.push(12);
Use .push() to add the string "freeCodeCamp" to the end of your rows array. Add this code before your console.log so you can see the change you made to your array.
*/

// let character = 'Hello';
// let count = 8;
// let rows = ["Naomi", "Quincy", "CamperChan"];
// rows.push("freeCodeCamp");
// console.log(rows);

/*
Step 22:
Another method essential for this project is the .pop() method. It removes the last element from an array and returns that element.
When a method returns a value, you can think of it as giving the value back to you, making it available for use in other parts of your code.
Declare a popped variable, and assign it the result of rows.pop(). Then, log your popped variable.
*/

// let character = 'Hello';
// let count = 8;
// let rows = ["Naomi", "Quincy", "CamperChan"];
// rows.push("freeCodeCamp");
// let popped = rows.pop();
// console.log(popped);
// console.log(rows);

/*
Step 23:
You should have seen "freeCodeCamp" printed to the console. This is because .pop() returns the value that was removed from the array - and you pushed "freeCodeCamp" to the end of the array earlier.
But what does .push() return? Assign your existing rows.push() to a new pushed variable, and log it.
*/

// let character = 'Hello';
// let count = 8;
// let rows = ["Naomi", "Quincy", "CamperChan"];
// let pushed = rows.push("freeCodeCamp");
// console.log(pushed);
// let popped = rows.pop();
// console.log(popped);
// console.log(rows);

/*
Step 24:
Were you expecting to see 4 in the console? .push() returns the new length of the array, after adding the value you give it.
It is important to be aware of what values a method returns. Take some time to experiment with .push() and .pop(). 
When you are ready, remove all of your .push() and .pop() calls, and your console.log statements.
*/

// let character = 'Hello';
// let count = 8;
// let rows = ["Naomi", "Quincy", "CamperChan"];

/*
Step 25:
Change your rows declaration to be assigned an empty array again.
Also, change your 'Hello' string to use double quotes again. Generally, it does not matter which of the two you prefer, but you will want to be consistent in that choice throughout your project.
*/

// let character = "Hello";
// let count = 8;
// let rows = [];

/*
Step 26:
The let keyword allows a variable to be reassigned. This means you could change character later to be a completely different value.
For this project, you will not want to change these variable values. So instead, you should use const to declare them. const variables are special.
First, a const variable cannot be reassigned like a let variable. This code would throw an error:
                const firstName = "Naomi";
                firstName = "Jessica";
A const variable also cannot be uninitialized. This code would throw an error:
                const firstName;
Replace your let keywords with const.
*/

// const character = "Hello";
// const count = 8;
// const rows = [];

/*
Step 27:
You are now ready to start building your pyramid generator. Your character variable will serve as the building block for the pyramid.
"Hello" might not work very well for that. Change the value of character to be the hash character "#".
*/

// const character = "#";
// const count = 8;
// const rows = [];

/*
Step 28:
To generate a pyramid, you will need to create multiple rows. When you have to perform a task repeatedly until a condition is met, you will use a loop. There are many ways to write a loop.
You are going to start with a basic for loop. for loops use the following syntax:

                for (iterator; condition; iteration) {
                logic;
                }
In the upcoming steps, you'll explore each component of a loop in detail. For now, construct a for loop that includes the terms "iterator", "condition", and "iteration" for the three components. 
Keep the loop body, the section within the curly braces {}, empty.
*/

// const character = "#";
// const count = 8;
// const rows = [];
// for ("iterator"; "condition"; "iteration") {

// }

/*
Step 29:
Your loop now needs a proper iterator. The iterator is a variable you can declare specifically in your for loop to control how the loop iterates or goes through your logic.
It is a common convention to use i as your iterator variable in a loop. A for loop allows you to declare this in the parentheses (). For example, here is a for loop that declares an index variable and assigns it the value 100.
                for (let index = 100; "second"; "third") {

                }
Replace the string "iterator" with a let declaration for the variable i. Assign it the value 0 to start. This will give the i variable the value 0 the first time your loop runs.
*/

// const character = "#";
// const count = 8;
// const rows = [];
// for (let i = 0; "condition"; "iteration") {

// }

/*
Step 30:
The condition of a for loop tells the loop how many times it should iterate. When the condition becomes false, the loop will stop.
In JavaScript, a Boolean value can be either true or false. These are not strings - you will learn more about the difference later on.
For now, you will use the less than operator (<). This allows you to check if the value on the left is less than the value on the right. For example, count < 3 would evaluate to true if count is 2, and false if count is 4.
Replace your "condition" string with a condition to check if i is less than count.
*/

// const character = "#";
// const count = 8;
// const rows = [];
// for (let i = 0; i < count; "iteration") {

// }

/*
Step 31:
Your iteration statement will tell your loop what to do with the iterator after each run.
When you reassign a variable, you can use the variable to reference the previous value before the reassignment. This allows you to do things like add three to an existing number. For example, bees = bees + 3; would increase the value of bees by three.
Use that syntax to replace your "iteration" string with a reassignment statement that increases i by one.
*/

// const character = "#";
// const count = 8;
// const rows = [];
// for (let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {

// }

/*
Step 32:
Your loop should now run eight times. Inside the body of the loop, print the value of the i iterator and see what happens.
*/

// const character = "#";
// const count = 8;
// const rows = [];

// for (let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {
//   console.log(i);
// }

/*
Step 33:
You should see the numbers zero through seven printed in your console, one per line. This will serve as the foundation for generating your pyramid.
Replace your log statement with a statement to push i to your rows array.
*/

// const character = "#";
// const count = 8;
// const rows = [];

// for (let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {
//   rows.push(i);
// }

/*
Step 34:
Unfortunately, now you cannot see what your loop is doing.
Use let to declare a result variable, and assign it an empty string. An empty string is represented by quotation marks with nothing between them, such as "".
*/

// const character = "#";
// const count = 8;
// const rows = [];

// for (let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {
//   rows.push(i);
// }

// let result = ""


/*
Step 35:
Add a log statement to print the value of result. Depending on which console you use, you may not see anything printed.
*/

// const character = "#";
// const count = 8;
// const rows = [];

// for (let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {
//   rows.push(i);
// }

// let result = ""

// console.log(result);


/*
Step 36:
To manipulate the result string, you will use a different type of loop. Specifically, a for...of loop, which iterates over each item in an iterable object and temporarily assigns it to a variable.
The syntax for a for...of loop looks like:
                for (const value of iterable) {

                }
Note that you can use const because the variable only exists for a single iteration, not during the entire loop.
Create a for...of loop to iterate through your rows array, assigning each value to a row variable.
*/

// const character = "#";
// const count = 8;
// const rows = [];

// for (let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {
//   rows.push(i);
// }

// let result = ""

// for (const row of rows) {

// }

// console.log(result);

/*
Step 37: 
Remember in your previous loop that you used the addition operator + to increase the value of i by 1.
You can do a similar thing with a string value, by appending a new string to an existing string. For example, hello = hello + " World"; 
would add the string " World" to the existing string stored in the hello variable. This is called concatenation.
In your for...of loop, use the addition operator to concatenate the row value to the result value.
*/

// const character = "#";
// const count = 8;
// const rows = [];

// for (let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {
//   rows.push(i);
// }

// let result = ""

// for (const row of rows) {
//   result = result + row;
// }

// console.log(result);

/*
Step 38:
Now all of your numbers are appearing on the same line. This will not work for creating a pyramid.
You will need to add a new line to each row. However, pressing the return key to insert a line break between quotes in JavaScript will result in a parsing error. 
Instead, you need to use the special escape sequence \n, which is interpreted as a new line when the string is logged. For example:
                lineOne = lineOne + "\n" + lineTwo;
Use a second addition operator to concatenate a new line between the existing result value and the added row value.
*/

// const character = "#";
// const count = 8;
// const rows = [];

// for (let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {
//   rows.push(i);
// }

// let result = ""

// for (const row of rows) {
//   result = result + "\n" + row;
// }

// console.log(result);

/*
Step 39:
Printing numbers won't result in a visually appealing pyramid. Now that you're outputting the formatted content of your rows array, it's time to update your original loop.
Instead of pushing i to the array, push the value of your character variable.
*/

// const character = "#";
// const count = 8;
// const rows = [];

// for (let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {
//   rows.push(character);
// }

// let result = ""

// for (const row of rows) {
//   result = result + "\n" + row;
// }

// console.log(result);

/*
Step 40:
Now you have a series of # characters, but the pyramid shape is still missing. Fortunately, the i variable represents the current "row" number in your loop, enabling you to use it for crafting a pyramid-like structure.
To achieve this, you will use the .repeat() method available to strings. This method accepts a number as an argument, specifying the number of times to repeat the target string. For example, using .repeat() to generate the string "Code! Code! Code!":
                const activity = "Code! ";
                activity.repeat(3);
Use the .repeat() method on your character, and give it i for the number.
*/

// const character = "#";
// const count = 8;
// const rows = [];

// for (let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {
//   rows.push(character.repeat(i))
// }

// let result = ""

// for (const row of rows) {
//   result = result + "\n" + row;
// }

// console.log(result);

/*
Step 41:
You're getting closer! At this point, you're encountering what's known as an off-by-one error, a frequent problem in zero-based indexing languages like JavaScript.
The first index of your rows array is 0, which is why you start your for loop with i = 0. But repeating a string zero times results in nothing to print.
To fix this, add 1 to the value of i in your .repeat() call. Do not assign it back to i like you did in your loop conditions.
*/

// const character = "#";
// const count = 8;
// const rows = [];

// for (let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {
//   rows.push(character.repeat(i + 1))
// }

// let result = ""

// for (const row of rows) {
//   result = result + "\n" + row;
// }

// console.log(result);

/*
Step 42:
The logic for formatting this pyramid is likely going to get complicated, which means it's a great time to extract that code into a function.
A function is a block of code that can be reused throughout your application. Functions are declared with the following syntax:
                function name(parameter) {

                }
The function keyword tells JavaScript that the name variable is going to be a function. parameter is a variable that represents a value that is passed into the function when it is used. A function may have as many, or as few, parameters as you'd like. Like a for loop, the space between the curly braces is the function body.
Declare a padRow function. Do not create any parameter variables yet. The function body should be empty. Remember that you need to use camel case for your naming convention.
*/

// const character = "#";
// const count = 8;
// const rows = [];

// function padRow() {

// }

// for (let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {
//   rows.push(character.repeat(i + 1))
// }

// let result = ""

// for (const row of rows) {
//   result = result + "\n" + row;
// }

// console.log(result);

/*
Step 43:
In order to use a function, you need to call it. A function call tells your application to run the code from the function wherever you choose to call it. The syntax for a function call is the function name followed by parentheses. For example, this code defines and calls a test function.
                function test() {

                }
                test();
Call your padRow function.
*/

// const character = "#";
// const count = 8;
// const rows = [];

// function padRow() {

// }
// padRow();


// for (let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {
//   rows.push(character.repeat(i + 1))
// }

// let result = ""

// for (const row of rows) {
//   result = result + "\n" + row;
// }

// console.log(result);


/*
Step 44:
You are calling your padRow function, but not doing anything with that function call. All functions in JavaScript return a value, meaning they provide the defined result of calling them for you to use elsewhere.
To see the result of calling your padRow function, declare a call variable and assign your existing padRow call to that variable.
*/

// const character = "#";
// const count = 8;
// const rows = [];

// function padRow() {

// }
// const call = padRow();


// for (let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {
//   rows.push(character.repeat(i + 1))
// }

// let result = ""

// for (const row of rows) {
//   result = result + "\n" + row;
// }

// console.log(result);

/*
Step 45:
Now add a log statement to print the value of your call variable.
*/

// const character = "#";
// const count = 8;
// const rows = [];

// function padRow() {

// }
// const call = padRow();
// console.log(call);


// for (let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {
//   rows.push(character.repeat(i + 1))
// }

// let result = ""

// for (const row of rows) {
//   result = result + "\n" + row;
// }

// console.log(result);


/*
Step 46:
Your call variable has an undefined value, even though you defined it! This is because your padRow function does not currently return a value. By default, functions return undefined as their value.
In order to return something else, you need to use the return keyword. Here is an example of a function that returns the string "Functions are cool!":
                function demo() {
                return "Functions are cool!";
                }
Use the return keyword to have your function return the string "Hello!".
*/

// const character = "#";
// const count = 8;
// const rows = [];

// function padRow() {
//   return "Hello!";
// }
// const call = padRow();
// console.log(call);


// for (let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {
//   rows.push(character.repeat(i + 1))
// }

// let result = ""

// for (const row of rows) {
//   result = result + "\n" + row;
// }

// console.log(result);

/*
Step 47:
When you have a value that is explicitly written in your code, like the "Hello!" string in your function, it is considered to be hard-coded. Hard-coding a value inside a function might not make it as reusable as you'd like.
Instead, you can define parameters for the function. Parameters are special variables that are given a value when you call the function, and can be used in your function to dynamically change the result of the function's code.
To add a parameter to your function, you need to add a variable name inside the parentheses. For example, this demo function has a name parameter:
        function demo(name) {

        }
name sounds like a useful parameter, so go ahead and add it to your padRow function.
*/

// const character = "#";
// const count = 8;
// const rows = [];

// function padRow(name) {
//   return "Hello!";
// }
// const call = padRow();
// console.log(call);


// for (let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {
//   rows.push(character.repeat(i + 1))
// }

// let result = ""

// for (const row of rows) {
//   result = result + "\n" + row;
// }

// console.log(result);

/*
Step 48:
A function does not have to return a hard-coded value. It can return the value stored in a variable. Parameters are special variables for a function, so they can also be returned.
Change your padRow function to return the name parameter directly.
*/

// const character = "#";
// const count = 8;
// const rows = [];

// function padRow(name) {
//   return name;
// }
// const call = padRow();
// console.log(call);


// for (let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {
//   rows.push(character.repeat(i + 1))
// }

// let result = ""

// for (const row of rows) {
//   result = result + "\n" + row;
// }

// console.log(result);

/*
Step 49:
If you open your console again, you'll see that your padRow function is returning undefined, even though you defined a return value! This is because parameters need to be given a value when you call the function.
When you pass a value to a function call, that value is referred to as an argument. Here is an example of calling a demo function and passing "Naomi" as the argument for the name parameter.

                function demo(name) {
                return name;
                }
demo("Naomi");
Pass your own name as the argument for the name parameter in your padRow call. Remember that your name is a string, so you'll need to use quotes.
*/

// const character = "#";
// const count = 8;
// const rows = [];

// function padRow(name) {
//   return name;
// }
// const call = padRow("CamperChan");
// console.log(call);


// for (let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {
//   rows.push(character.repeat(i + 1))
// }

// let result = ""

// for (const row of rows) {
//   result = result + "\n" + row;
// }

// console.log(result);

/*
Step 50:
Variables in JavaScript are available in a specific scope. In other words, where a variable is declared determines where in your code it can be used.

The first scope is the global scope. Variables that are declared outside of any "block" like a function or for loop are in the global scope. Your character, count, and rows variables are all in the global scope.

When a variable is in the global scope, a function can access it in its definition. Here is an example of a function using a global title variable:

                const title = "Professor ";
                function demo(name) {
                return title + name;
                }
demo("Naomi")
This example would return "Professor Naomi". Update your padRow function to return the value of concatenating your character variable to the beginning of the name parameter.
*/

// const character = "#";
// const count = 8;
// const rows = [];

// function padRow(name) {
//   return character + name;

// }

// const call = padRow("CamperChan");
// console.log(call);


// for (let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {
//   rows.push(character.repeat(i + 1))
// }

// let result = ""

// for (const row of rows) {
//   result = result + "\n" + row;
// }

// console.log(result);

/*
Step 51:
Variables can also be declared inside a function. These variables are considered to be in the local scope, or block scope. A variable declared inside a function can only be used inside that function. If you try to access it outside of the function, you will either get undefined or an error.
To see this in action, use const to declare a test variable in your padRow function. Initialise it with the value "Testing".
Then, below your function, try to log test to the console. You will see an error because it is not defined outside of the function's local scope. Remove that console.log to pass the tests and continue.
*/

// const character = "#";
// const count = 8;
// const rows = [];

// function padRow(name) {
  
//   return character + name;
//   const test = "Testing";
// }

// const call = padRow("CamperChan");
// console.log(call);


// for (let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {
//   rows.push(character.repeat(i + 1))
// }

// let result = ""

// for (const row of rows) {
//   result = result + "\n" + row;
// }

// console.log(result);

/*
Step 52:
There is a bit of a problem, here. Your test declaration is currently after your return statement. An important thing to know about the return keyword is that it does not just define a value to be returned from your function, it also stops the execution of your function code. This means that any code after a return statement will not run.
Move your test initialization to the line above your return statement.
*/

// const character = "#";
// const count = 8;
// const rows = [];

// function padRow(name) {
//   const test = "Testing";
//   return character + name;
// }

// const call = padRow("CamperChan");
// console.log(call);


// for (let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {
//   rows.push(character.repeat(i + 1))
// }

// let result = ""

// for (const row of rows) {
//   result = result + "\n" + row;
// }

// console.log(result);


/*
Step 53:
If you try to add a console.log(test) call below your padRow function, you would see an error. This is because test is defined in the local scope, meaning you cannot access it in the global scope (outside of the padRow function).
Returning a value from a function brings that value into the scope where the function was called. To bring your "Testing" value from the padRow function into the global scope, update your return statement to return only the test variable.
*/

// const character = "#";
// const count = 8;
// const rows = [];

// function padRow(name) {
//   const test = "Testing";
//   return test;
// }
// const call = padRow("CamperChan");
// console.log(call);

// for (let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {
//   rows.push(character.repeat(i + 1))
// }

// let result = ""

// for (const row of rows) {
//   result = result + "\n" + row;
// }

// console.log(result);

/*
Step 54:
Now your call variable has the value "Testing". But your function is no longer using the name parameter.
Remove the name parameter from your function declaration, then remove your "CamperChan" string from the padRow call.
*/

// const character = "#";
// const count = 8;
// const rows = [];

// function padRow() {
//   const test = "Testing";
//   return test;
// }
// const call = padRow();

// }

// let result = ""

// for (const row of rows) {
//   result = result + "\n" + row;
// }

// console.log(result);

/*
Step 55:
Because your function was no longer using the parameter, changing the value passed in the call did not affect it.
Go ahead and remove the test declaration from your padRow function. Also, remove the return statement, so your function is empty again.
*/

// const character = "#";
// const count = 8;
// const rows = [];

// function padRow() {

// }
// const call = padRow();
// console.log(call);

// }

// let result = ""

// for (const row of rows) {
//   result = result + "\n" + row;
// }

// console.log(result);

/*
Step 56:
As expected, your function now returns undefined again. Your call variable is not necessary any more, so remove the call declaration and the console.log for the call variable.
*/

// const character = "#";
// const count = 8;
// const rows = [];

// function padRow() {

// }


// for (let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {

// }

// let result = ""

// for (const row of rows) {
//   result = result + "\n" + row;
// }

// console.log(result);

/*
Step 57:
In order to know how to format a row, your padRow function will need to know which row number you are on, and how many rows in total are being generated.
The best way to do this is by creating function parameters for them. Give your padRow function a rowNumber and rowCount parameter. Multiple parameters are separated by a comma:
                function name(first, second) {

                }
*/

// const character = "#";
// const count = 8;

// }

// let result = ""

// for (const row of rows) {
//   result = result + "\n" + row;
// }

// console.log(result);

/*
Step 58:
Remember in an earlier step, you learned about return values. A function can return a value for your application to consume separately.
In a function, the return keyword is used to specify a return value. For example, this function would return the value given to the first parameter:
                function name(parameter) {
                return parameter;
                }
Use the return keyword to return the value of the character variable, repeated rowNumber times.
*/

// const character = "#";
// const count = 8;
// const rows = [];

// function padRow(rowNumber, rowCount) {
//   return character.repeat(rowNumber);

//   rows.push(character.repeat(i + 1))
// }

// let result = ""

// for (const row of rows) {
//   result = result + "\n" + row;
// }

// console.log(result);

/*
Step 59:
A function call allows you to actually use a function. You may not have been aware of it, but the methods like .push() that you have been using have been function calls.
A function is called by referencing the function's name, and adding (). Here's how to call a test function:
                test();
Replace the character.repeat(i + 1) in your .push() call with a function call for your padRow function.
*/

// const character = "#";
// const count = 8;
// const rows = [];

// function padRow(rowNumber, rowCount) {

//   rows.push(padRow())
// }

// let result = ""

// for (const row of rows) {
//   result = result + "\n" + row;
// }

// console.log(result);

/*
Step 60:
Your padRow function has two parameters which you defined. Values are provided to those parameters when a function is called.
The values you provide to a function call are referred to as arguments, and you pass arguments to a function call. Here's a function call with "Hello" passed as an argument:
                test("Hello");
Pass i + 1 and count as the arguments to your padRow call. Like parameters, arguments are separated by a comma.

Step 61:
You should now see the same bunch of characters in your console. Your padRow function is doing the exact same thing you were doing earlier, but now it's in a reusable section of its own.

Step 64:
Now it is time for a bit of math. Consider a three-row pyramid. If we want it centered, it would look something like:
                ··#··
                ·###·
                #####
Empty spaces have been replaced with interpuncts, or middle dots, for readability. If you extrapolate the pattern, you can see that the spaces at the beginning and end of a row follow a pattern.
Update your blank space strings to be repeated rowCount - rowNumber times.
Open up the console to see the result.

// const character = "#";
// const count = 8;

// }

// let result = ""

// for (const row of rows) {
//   result = result + "\n" + row;
// }

// console.log(result);

/*
Step 65:
You can pass full expressions as an argument. The function will receive the result of evaluating that expression. For example, these two function calls would yield the same result:
                test(2 * 3 + 1);
                test(7);
Looking at the pattern again:
                ··#··
                ·###·
                #####
Update the character value to be repeated 2 * rowNumber - 1 times.
Open up the console again to see the updated result.

// let result = ""

// for (const row of rows) {

// console.log(result);

/*
Step 66:
Your pyramid generator now functions as expected. But this is an excellent opportunity to further explore the code you have written.
The addition operator is not the only way to add values to a variable. The addition assignment operator can be used as shorthand to mean "take the original value of the variable, add this value, and assign the result back to the variable." For example, these two statements would yield the same result:
                test = test + 1;
                test += 1;
Update your iterator statement in the for loop to use addition assignment.

// }

// let result = ""

// for (const row of rows) {
//   result = result + "\n" + row;
// }

// console.log(result);

/*
Step 67:
Because you are only increasing i by 1, you can use the increment operator ++. This operator increases the value of a variable by 1, updating the assignment for that variable. For example, test would become 8 here:
                let test = 7;
                test++;
Replace your addition assignment with the increment operator for your loop iteration.

Step 76:
JavaScript also has support for multi-line comments. A multi-line comment starts with /* and ends with *//*
Unlike a single-line comment, a multi-line comment will encapsulate multiple lines.
Use /* and */ /*to turn your current for loop, including the body, into a multi-line comment.

/*
Step 77:
Your pyramid has disappeared again. That's okay - that is to be expected.
Before you create your new loop, you need to learn about if statements. An if statement allows you to run a block of code only when a condition is met. They use the following syntax:
                Example Code
                if (condition) {
                logic
                }
Create an if statement with the boolean true as the condition. In the body, print the string "Condition is true".

// }*/

// if (true) {
//   console.log("Condition is true");
// }

// let result = ""

// for (const row of rows) {
//   result = result + "\n" + row;
// }

// console.log(result);



/*
Step 78:
You'll see the string printed in the console, because true is in fact true.
Change the condition of your if statement to the boolean false.

//   console.log("Condition is true");
// }

// let result = ""

// for (const row of rows) {
//   result = result + "\n" + row;
// }

// console.log(result);


/*
Step 79:
Now the string is no longer printing, because false is not true. But what about other values?
Try changing the condition to the string "false".

/*
Step 80:
The text has appeared again! This is because "false" is a string, which when evaluated to a boolean becomes true. This means "false" is a truthy value.
A truthy value is a value that is considered true when evaluated as a boolean. Most of the values you encounter in JavaScript will be truthy.
A falsy value is the opposite - a value considered false when evaluated as a boolean. JavaScript has a defined list of falsy values. Some of them include false, 0, "", null, undefined, and NaN.
Try changing your if condition to an empty string "", which is a falsy value.

// }

// console.log(result);


/*
Step 81:
The text is gone again! Empty strings evaluate to false, making them a falsy value. You will learn more about truthy and falsy values in future projects.
In addition to if statements, JavaScript also has else if statements. else if statements allow you to check multiple conditions in a single block of code.
Here is the syntax for an else if statement:
                Example Code
                if (condition1) {
                  // code to run if condition1 is true
                } else if (condition2) {
                  // code to run if condition2 is true
                } else if (condition3) {
                  // code to run if condition3 is true
                } 
If the first condition is false, JavaScript will check the next condition in the chain. If the second condition is false, JavaScript will check the third condition, and so on.
Below your if statement, add an else if statement that checks if 5 is less than 10. Then inside the body of the else if statement, log the string "5 is less than 10" to the console.
Check the console to see the results.
*/


// const character = "#";
// const count = 8;
// const rows = [];

// function padRow(rowNumber, rowCount) {
//   return " ".repeat(rowCount - rowNumber) + character.repeat(2 * rowNumber - 1) + " ".repeat(rowCount - rowNumber);
// }

// // TODO: use a different type of loop
// /*for (let i = 1; i <= count; i++) {
//   rows.push(padRow(i, count));
// }*/

// if ("") {
//   console.log("Condition is true");
// } else if (5 < 10) {
//   console.log("5 is less than 10");
// }

// let result = ""

// for (const row of rows) {
//   result = result + "\n" + row;
// }

// console.log(result);


/*
Step 82:
Sometimes you will want to run different code when all of the if...else if conditions are false. You can do this by adding an else block.
An else block will only evaluate if the conditions in the if and else if blocks are not met.
Here the else block is added to the else if block.
Example Code
                if (condition) {
                  // this code will run if condition is true
                } else if (condition2) {
                  // this code will run if the first condition is false
                } else {
                  // this code will run 
                  // if the first and second conditions are false
                }
Add an else block to the else if block. Inside the else block, log the string "This is the else block" to the console.
To see the results in the console, you can manually change the < in the else if statement to >. That will make the condition false and the else block will run.

/*
Step 83:
Now that you have practiced working with if...else if...else statements, you can remove them from your code.
Once you complete that, use let to declare a continueLoop variable and assign it the boolean false. Then use let to declare a done variable and assign it the value 0.

A while loop will run over and over again until the condition specified is no longer true. It has the following syntax:

                while (condition) {
                  logic;

Step 115:
If your pyramid is not inverted, then you will want to have an else block that builds the pyramid in the normal order.
In earlier steps, you learned how to work with else statement like this:
                Example Code
                if (condition) {
                  // if condition is true, run this code
                } else {
                  // if condition is false, run this code
                }
Add an else block to your if block.

Your pyramid generator is now in a finished state, with more functionality than you originally planned! The next step is to clean up your code.
Remove all comments, both single- and multi-line, from your code.
