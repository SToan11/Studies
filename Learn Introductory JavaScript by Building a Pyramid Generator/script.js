Step 1: 
JavaScript is the programming language that powers the web. Unlike the HTML and CSS you have learned previously, JavaScript is most commonly used to write logic instead of markup.
One of the most important concepts in programming is variables. A variable points to a specific memory address that stores a value. 
Variables are given a name which can be used throughout your code to access that value.
Declaring a variable means giving it a name. In JavaScript, this is often done with the let keyword. For example, here is how you would declare a hello variable:
let hello;
Variable naming follows specific rules: names can include letters, numbers, dollar signs, and underscores, but cannot contain spaces and must not begin with a number.
Declare a character variable in your code.
Note: It is common practice to end statements in JavaScript with a semicolon. ; 
*/

//let character;

/*
Step 2:
Your character variable currently does not have a value. You can assign a value using the assignment operator =. For example:
let hello = "Hello";
Assigning a value to a variable at the moment of its declaration is known as initialization.
Initialize your character variable by assigning it the value "Hello" during its declaration.
*/

// let character = "Hello";

/*
Step 3:
JavaScript has seven primitive data types, with String being one of them. In JavaScript, a string represents 
a sequence of characters and can be enclosed in either single (') or double (") quotes.
Note that strings are immutable, which means once they are created, they cannot be changed.
Change your "Hello" string to use single quotes.
*/

let character = 'Hello';
